# Predicting Wheat Yields in China
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting wheat yields in China using various features. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast wheat yields based on factors such as temperature, precipitation, and other relevant data.

# Data Collection
Thus far, Temperature and precipitation data for the top 10 wheat-producing provinces in China was collected using Selenium web scraping. 

# Usage of Features in Machine Learning Models
The collected features, including temperature and precipitation, are used as inputs to train machine learning models for wheat yield prediction. One potential model that can be used is a neural network. The features are fed into the neural network as input nodes, and the network learns to map the input features to the corresponding wheat yields. The trained model can then be used to make predictions on unseen data.

# Future Steps
- Further Model Refinement: 
The existing machine learning models can be fine-tuned and optimized to improve their performance and accuracy in predicting wheat yields.

- Integration with Trading Strategies: 
Once the predictive models demonstrate satisfactory performance, the predictions can be utilized to inform potential trades in wheat futures. The models can help identify favorable trading opportunities based on predicted wheat yield trends and other market indicators.

- Continuous Data Updates: 
The data collection process can be automated to ensure the availability of up-to-date temperature, precipitation, and other relevant data for accurate predictions and trading decisions.
